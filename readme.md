### Greetings from Babylon 5

"It was the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind, ten years after the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project 
was a dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place where Humans and aliens 
could work out their differences peacefully. It's a port of call – home away from home for diplomats, 
hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five-hundred thousand 
tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope 
for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place 
is Babylon 5." – Commander Jeffrey Sinclair

### About B5Code
        
This is my attempt to create a Babylon 5 version of the traditional "Hello World" application in as many 
programming languages as I can. All it does is simply print the following line: "..and so it begins." If
you're a Babylon 5 fan you'll immediately know who said that. Why am I doing this? Because I can? :-)
